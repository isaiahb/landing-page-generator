# landing-page-generator

## Inspiration
As programmers, we collectively realized how much we disliked the process of creating a pitch site/landing page to explain our project - it took away precious time from working on the actual product! We recognized our shared need for a quick landing page solution, which would sum up the basics of our project, idea, and solution for any viewer to understand.

## What it does
MyLandingPage creates a landing page site for an emerging project within seconds. Based on an elevator pitch of a project, MyLandingPage uses Cohere's large language model to generate informative copy for the website (the headline, product description, benefits/solutions, and a call to action), and DALL-E to generate relevant images for the project.

## How we built it
We used MongoDB, Express, React, Node, Typescript, Cohere, Google Cloud Platform, CICD, and AppEngine in order to create our final product.
